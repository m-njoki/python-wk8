# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

# Description:

This project provides an analysis of COVID-19 data across various countries, focusing on the trends of total cases, deaths, vaccinations, and the impact of vaccinations on the progression of the pandemic. It includes visualizations such as time-series plots, choropleth maps, and comparisons across countries like Kenya, USA, and India.

# Objectives of the Project:
Data Collection: Gather COVID-19 data from the "Our World in Data" repository.
Data Cleaning & Exploration: Clean the data by filtering missing values, transforming date columns, and focusing on specific countries of interest.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate insightful visualizations including total cases, deaths, vaccination trends, and comparison of metrics between countries.
Choropleth Map: Build an interactive choropleth map that shows the total COVID-19 cases by country.
Insights: Provide reflections on the trends, vaccination impacts, and regional disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates.

# Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: Primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations like line plots and bar charts.
Plotly Express: For interactive visualizations, specifically the choropleth map.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualizations.

# Insights and Reflections:

India’s COVID-19 Surge
: A significant increase in cases around mid-2021, reflecting the impact of the second wave.
Vaccination Progress
: There’s a clear correlation between higher vaccination rates and a reduction in new cases and deaths in some countries.
Disparity in Mortality Rate
: Differences in mortality rates across continents indicate a need for more targeted health interventions in certain regions.
